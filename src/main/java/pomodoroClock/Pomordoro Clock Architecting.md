PomodoroClock

Want this to be a desktop application on my laptop that blocks out everything except certain websites to allow me to study.

Needs to be an executable program on my latop
Needs to have a pop up display
Needs access to the interet and applications currently running on my laptop

Can start prototying with a stopwatch, and timer app also a clone of the task manager to track what programs 
are currently running and build up to learning how to prevent them from running when the pomodoro clock is running.
When all of this is done it's going to need some security features to prevent people from hacking it.


Display
- pop up window
- buttons for stop, resume, increase time, decrease time

Session storage 
- be able to track how many sessions i've used it. 
- have it modeled and graphed like github's sessions
